									<p>This project is a custom implementation of a loosely coupled extended Kalman filter. The goal of the filter is to provide better flight data for the other software modules. <a href="https://github.com/ubcaerodesign/full-fusion">full-fusion</a> is the primary repository, which features:</p>

                                        <li>Flight path visualizer, attitude visualizer, and flight data graphs</li>
                                        <li>Testing environment</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Another part of this project is the <a href="https://github.com/Egray180/gnss-ins-sim">data emulator</a>, which provides sensor data for user inputted flight paths (credit to Aceinna for making their GNSS/INS simulation project open source). I used the emulated data to test my software before deploying it in the plane. Final competition variants of the filter can be found in <a href="https://github.com/ubcaerodesign/codex">codex</a>.</p>

                                        <p>The empennage attachment connects the vertical and horizontal stabilizers to the tailboom. Worst cases for banking and landing were analyzed, tested with SolidWorks FEA, and physically tested. For FEA inputs, I calculated the moment that would be exerted on the part if the plane were to bank 45 degrees in one second, and the force on the part from landing. This design is a completely reimagined version of the part that was used in previous years, which was waterjet pieces of carbon fiber screwed together to clamp the tail boom and spars. As such, it required extensive concept explortaion and thought to design the part, and about 5 revisions in SolidWorks.</p>

They consist of two pieces — one piece is fixed to the center ribs of the fuselage and the other piece can be screwed on to secure the tail boom. They are cut out of 0.375” aluminum with a waterjet cutter, and the holes are added with a drill press after cutting and sanding.</p>

I designed and CNCed molds for carbon fiber wet layups to manufacture the leading edge and transition region. I used the laser cutter to manufacture wood components, and the waterjet cutter to cut carbon fiber sheets and aluminum. For parts like the empennage attachment and gps mount, I used a 3D printer to make them. My CAD work for the 2023 plane includes:</p>
